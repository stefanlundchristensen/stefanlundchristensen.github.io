I'm a physicist turned fintech leader. I spent years studying how systems work — first in a lab, then at McKinsey, and now at Pleo, where I've spent the last five years building and scaling the payments platform.

The work I'm most proud of isn't a system though — it's the people. Watching someone I've coached step into a leadership role they didn't think they were ready for is the best feeling in this job. I set a high bar, but I'm there every step of the way.

My physics background never really left. I still think in hypotheses and experiments — form a theory, test it, learn, adjust. It makes me analytical and technical, but fatherhood made me something else: a more human leader. Becoming a dad taught me to prioritize, to see people for who they actually are, and to bring my whole self to work. I went from a logical executor to an emotionally balanced leader who gets shit done.

At Pleo, I've focused on building platforms and organizations that scale — designing modular systems and team structures that abstract away complexity so people can ship fast and make good decisions without bottlenecks. That's the kind of problem I love: making hard things invisible so others can move at speed.

Outside of work, I'm usually at a show, listening to music, or just being a dad. Those things keep me grounded.

If any of the above resonates, I'm always happy to connect.
