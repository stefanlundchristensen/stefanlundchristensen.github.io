I've always been drawn to hard problems—the kind that require both technical depth and organizational finesse to solve. My career has been defined by a consistent thread: building things that scale and fixing things that matter.

## Background

My journey started in physics. I earned my PhD from the University of Copenhagen in 2024, with prior degrees in Physics (M.Sc in 2011, B.Sc in 2009). Physics taught me to think in systems, tackle problems without obvious answers, and hold myself to rigorous standards of evidence.

From there, I moved into consulting at McKinsey & Company, where I spent five years solving complex problems for leading European financial institutions—modernizing payment infrastructure, building anti-money laundering systems, and designing products. These years taught me how to translate ambiguous business challenges into actionable strategies and how to lead teams through uncertainty.

In 2019, I joined Pleo as an Entrepreneur in Residence and have spent the last five years scaling the company from 100 to 850+ people as Head of Payments and now Head of Platform. This is where theory meets practice at scale.

## What I Build

At Pleo, I've focused on creating organizations where the people closest to the customer make the decisions. My philosophy is simple: provide context, remove obstacles, and help teams move fast with confidence.

This approach has enabled:
- A 70% reduction in card scheme costs through strategic partnership optimization
- A unified platform organization of 100+ professionals across payments, analytics, product, security, and infrastructure
- Payment infrastructure capable of handling Europe's leading spend management platform

## Deep Expertise

My technical expertise centers on payments infrastructure and platform scaling:

- **Payment Rails**: Deep knowledge of card networks and Account-to-Account (A2A) systems across European markets
- **Platform Architecture**: Building systems that scale across hundreds of engineers and thousands of customers
- **Organizational Design**: Creating structures where teams operate autonomously without losing alignment
- **Regulatory Navigation**: Hands-on experience with European payment regulations (PSD2, compliance frameworks)
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategic cost reduction while maintaining quality and velocity
- **Leadership at Scale**: From teams of 4 to organizations of 100+

## Leadership Philosophy

I lead with authenticity and intellectual rigor. I trust in good intent and operate from the principle that disagreement is often a sign that someone knows something others don't—creating a culture of learning rather than hierarchy.

My leadership style combines:
- **Extreme urgency**: Moving fast on what matters
- **Radical accountability**: Owning outcomes, not just activities
- **Deep ownership**: Treating every problem as if it's mine to solve
- **People development**: Making everyone around me better

## What Drives Me

I'm motivated by enabling others to do their best work. Whether it's scaling a team, fixing a broken process, navigating complex regulatory requirements, or rethinking payment infrastructure, I focus on creating organizations capable of making decisions, executing with speed, and delivering results.

The organizations I build are designed to be self-standing—capable of independent judgment, rapid execution, and sustained performance without constant top-down direction.

This combination of technical depth, operational excellence, and people-first leadership has defined my career and continues to guide my work.
