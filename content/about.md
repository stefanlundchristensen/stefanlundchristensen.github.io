I've always been drawn to hard problems—the kind that require both technical depth and organizational finesse to solve. My career has been defined by a consistent thread: building things that scale and fixing things that matter.

## Background

My journey started in quantum physics, where I learned to think in systems and solve problems that don't have obvious answers. From there, I moved into consulting, where I developed the ability to quickly understand complex businesses and drive meaningful change. These experiences shaped how I approach leadership today: with intellectual rigor, practical execution, and an obsession with outcomes.

## What I Build

Throughout my career in FinTech, I've focused on creating self-sufficient organizations. My philosophy is simple: the people closest to the customer should make the decisions. My role is to provide context, remove obstacles, and help teams make decisions when they're not comfortable doing so alone.

This approach has allowed me to scale organizations effectively—from small teams to hundreds of people—while maintaining velocity and quality. At Pleo, I've been part of the journey from Series B to becoming Europe's leading spend management platform, helping grow the organization from 100 to 850 people.

## Deep Expertise

My technical expertise centers on payments infrastructure:

- **Payment Rails**: Deep knowledge of card networks and Account-to-Account (A2A) payment systems across European markets
- **Core Banking Systems**: Architecture and operations of modern banking infrastructure
- **Regulatory Navigation**: Hands-on experience with European payment regulations and compliance frameworks
- **Platform Building**: Creating digital and data platforms that scale

## Leadership Philosophy

I lead with authenticity and self-awareness. I trust in good intent and believe that if we disagree, either you know something I don't, or I know something you don't. This creates a culture of learning rather than hierarchy.

My leadership style combines:
- **Extreme urgency**: Moving fast on what matters
- **Radical accountability**: Owning outcomes, not just activities
- **Deep ownership**: Treating every problem as if it's mine to solve
- **People development**: Making everyone around me better

## What Drives Me

I'm motivated by making others successful. Whether it's scaling a team, fixing a broken process, or navigating complex regulatory requirements, I focus on enabling people to do their best work. The organizations I build are designed to be self-standing—capable of making decisions, executing with speed, and delivering results without constant top-down direction.

This combination of technical depth, operational excellence, and people-first leadership has defined my career and continues to guide my work today.
