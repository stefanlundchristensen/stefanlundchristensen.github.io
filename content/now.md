## At work

I'm SVP at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io), leading platform, data, IT, and our AI infrastructure buildout. The current focus is on three things:

- **AI infrastructure** — building the foundation for AI-powered product capabilities, alongside internal productivity tooling that's already changing how we work.
- **Cost structure** — renegotiating card scheme partnerships and optimizing our payment processing stack. We recently achieved a 70% reduction in card scheme costs.
- **Growing leaders** — I've got a leadership team of 7 running 100+ professionals. My job is making sure they have the context, autonomy, and support to make great decisions without me.

## Writing

I'm writing about the things I've learned building and scaling at Pleo — organizational design, payments infrastructure, platform engineering, and leadership. You can find it all on the [blog](/posts/).

Posts I'm most proud of right now:
- [Six Hard-Won Lessons from Building Payment Systems at Scale](/posts/payment-systems-lessons/)
- [Your Leadership Scorecard: What to Own When You Lead Beyond a Single Team](/posts/leadership-scorecard-beyond-single-team/)
- [Why "Do You Support Faster Payments?" Is the Wrong Question](/posts/european-payment-rails/)

## Exploring

A few things I keep coming back to:

- **How AI reshapes fintech infrastructure** — not the product layer (chatbots, copilots) but the boring important stuff: fraud detection, transaction monitoring, reconciliation, compliance automation.
- **European payment convergence** — SEPA Instant is now mandatory, PSD3 is taking shape, and A2A payments are gaining real traction. The fragmented European landscape is slowly consolidating, and the companies that understand the transition will win.
- **What "platform engineering" actually means** — the industry is coalescing around this term but most implementations miss the point. I think the answer is treating platforms as products, not shared services.

## Outside work

Listening to a lot of live music. Being a dad. Trying to read more books and fewer newsletters.
