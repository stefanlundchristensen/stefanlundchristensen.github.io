This section is under construction. More thoughtful pieces on leadership, scaling, product, and payments infrastructure coming soon.

I'm working on several deeper dives into topics that shaped my career:

- **Organizational design** at scale - How to build teams that make fast decisions without constant escalation
- **Payments infrastructure** - The hidden complexity behind the modern transaction rails
- **Product thinking** in B2B FinTech - Making bets that matter
- **Leadership lessons** - What I've learned scaling from 100 to 850 people

Check back soon. In the meantime, feel free to reach out directly at [stefan_christensen@protonmail.com](mailto:stefan_christensen@protonmail.com) if you want to discuss any of these topics.
