At 100 people, you can have everyone in a room. Product and engineering naturally sync. Decisions happen in hallway conversations. You ship fast because there's no bureaucracy yet.

At 850 people, the instinct is to add more coordination. More roadmap reviews. More approval layers. More shared services that every team depends on. This feels like scaling, but it's actually the beginning of organizational sclerosis.

## The Self-Sufficient Model

The alternative is to build business units that can operate independently—teams that have everything they need to make decisions and execute without constant escalation. Not autonomous in the sense of "do whatever you want," but self-sufficient in the sense of "you have the capabilities and authority to serve your customers."

### Key Principles

**Decision-Making Authority**: The people closest to the customer should make the decisions. Leadership provides context, not commands. At Pleo, product managers decided pricing changes, feature prioritization, and go-to-market strategy for their segments without executive approval. Leadership set the overall company strategy and financial constraints, then trusted teams to execute within those boundaries.

**Complete Teams**: Each unit needs product, engineering, design, data, and go-to-market capabilities. No dependency on shared services for critical path work. We had teams that could ship an entire feature—from customer research through design, development, analytics instrumentation, and launch communications—without waiting on another team. Shared platform services existed, but only for non-blocking infrastructure.

**Clear Metrics**: Teams need to know what success looks like and have the tools to measure it themselves. Not vanity metrics handed down from above, but metrics the team owns and can actually move. If you're measured on conversion rate, you need the ability to run experiments, access to analytics, and authority to change the experience.

**Trust in Good Intent**: Assume everyone is trying to do the right thing. When disagreements happen, it's because someone knows something others don't. This isn't naive—it's practical. If you default to "they must be wrong" instead of "what do they see that I don't?", you create defensive behavior and politics. Trust first, then verify understanding.

## Making It Work at Scale

As we scaled from 100 to 850 people at Pleo, this model proved essential. But it requires discipline:

**Clear boundaries between units**: We explicitly defined which team owned which customer segments and product areas. When there was overlap, we had a decision-making framework (usually: the team closest to the customer decides, others provide input).

**Strong context-setting from leadership**: Quarterly all-hands where leadership shared company strategy, financial performance, and strategic priorities. Teams made better decisions when they understood the broader context.

**Investment in platform capabilities that all teams can leverage**: Authentication, payments infrastructure, data pipelines, compliance tooling—these lived in platform teams so product teams could focus on customer problems, not reinventing infrastructure.

**A culture that rewards autonomy and accountability**: We celebrated teams that made bold decisions and learned from them. We didn't punish intelligent failures. But we did hold teams accountable for results.

The result? Teams that moved fast, made good decisions, and didn't need permission to serve customers well. Feature velocity stayed high even as headcount grew 8x.
