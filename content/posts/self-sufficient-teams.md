One of the most critical challenges in scaling a FinTech company is maintaining velocity as you grow. The instinct is often to add more coordination, more approvals, more central planning. But this creates bottlenecks and slows everyone down.

## The Self-Sufficient Model

The alternative is to build business units that can operate independently—teams that have everything they need to make decisions and execute without constant escalation.

### Key Principles

**Decision-Making Authority**: The people closest to the customer should make the decisions. Leadership provides context, not commands.

**Complete Teams**: Each unit needs product, engineering, design, data, and go-to-market capabilities. No dependency on shared services for critical path work.

**Clear Metrics**: Teams need to know what success looks like and have the tools to measure it themselves.

**Trust in Good Intent**: Assume everyone is trying to do the right thing. When disagreements happen, it's because someone knows something others don't.

## Making It Work at Scale

As we scaled from 100 to 850 people at Pleo, this model proved essential. But it requires discipline:

- Clear boundaries between units
- Strong context-setting from leadership
- Investment in platform capabilities that all teams can leverage
- A culture that rewards autonomy and accountability

The result? Teams that move fast, make good decisions, and don't need permission to serve customers well.
