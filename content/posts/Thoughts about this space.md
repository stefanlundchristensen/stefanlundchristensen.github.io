**TLDR**: Closer to 40, I’ve learned a lot from payments, platform engineering,
and team building. Writing helps me reflect, and I believe in sharing
to help others grow too. Expect irregular posts on leadership, tech,
and whatever’s on my mind.

As I get closer to 40, I’ve gathered some learnings and perspectives
that shape how I approach my work every day. I’ve been fortunate to
work in payments, platform engineering, and building strong, effective
teams, and each of these areas has challenged me to grow and rethink
how I approach leadership and problem-solving.

Writing is something I do mainly for myself—it helps me think through
ideas and reflect on my experiences. But I’ve always believed that
sharing what I know can help others, too. Whether it’s through
conversations with my team or reflecting on my own journey, discussing
ideas has always been a way to learn and grow together.

This blog will be a place where I explore whatever's on my mind. You
can expect topics around payments, platform engineering, leadership,
and team building. I don’t promise regular updates, but when
inspiration strikes, I’ll make sure to share something worth thinking
about.
