SVP Product & Engineering at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io). I lead 100+ people across platform engineering, payments infrastructure, and core banking integrations.

Over five years I've helped scale Pleo from 100 to 850+ people—building the payment systems, platform teams, and organizational structures that let a FinTech move fast without breaking money.

European payment rails, card issuing, real-time settlement, regulatory complexity across 15+ markets. That's my day job.

Before Pleo: McKinsey (financial institutions), and a PhD in quantum physics building atomic clocks.
