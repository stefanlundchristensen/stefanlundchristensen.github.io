Physicist turned fintech leader. I build platforms, scale organizations, and help people do their best work.

Currently SVP at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io), where I've spent the last five years scaling the company from 100 to 850+ people across payments, platform, and engineering.

Before that: McKinsey consultant, quantum physicist, and occasional atomic clock builder.
