SVP Product & Engineering at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io). I lead 100+ people across platform engineering, payments infrastructure, and core banking integrations.

Over five years I've helped scale Pleo from 100 to 850+ people—building the payment systems, platform teams, and organizational structures that let a FinTech move fast without breaking money.

European payment rails, card issuing, real-time settlement, regulatory complexity across 15+ markets. That's my day job.

**What I've delivered:** 70% reduction in card scheme costs. Scaled from 5 to 15 markets in 11 months. 300% increase in engineering throughput. 20 percentage point margin uplift through payment processor migration.

Before Pleo: McKinsey (financial institutions), and a PhD in quantum physics building atomic clocks.

## Recent Writing

I write about scaling organizations, payments infrastructure, and platform engineering. Here's what I'm thinking about:

- [Why "Do You Support Faster Payments?" Is the Wrong Question](/posts/european-payment-rails/) — What we learned at Pleo about banking partnerships the hard way
- [From Twelve Options to One Command](/posts/platform-engineering-approach/) — How we transformed platform engineering at Pleo
- [Building Self-Sufficient Business Units](/posts/self-sufficient-teams/) — Scaling from 100 to 850 people without adding coordination layers
