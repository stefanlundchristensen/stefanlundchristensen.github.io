I build the systems that turn complexity into advantage. Whether it's organizational structure, scaling teams, payments infrastructure, or technical systems - I create the foundations that let companies move fast as they grow.

Currently SVP at [Pleo](https://www.pleo.io), where I've spent five years scaling the platform organization from 100 to 850+ people. We turned payments infrastructure into a competitive moat.

Before that: McKinsey consultant focused on financial institutions, and a PhD physicist who built atomic clocks.
