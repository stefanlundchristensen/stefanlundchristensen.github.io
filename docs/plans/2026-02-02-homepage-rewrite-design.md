# Homepage Rewrite Design

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Approved

## Objective

Rewrite the stefanchristensen.me homepage to position Stefan as a company builder/transformation leader with deep fintech/payments expertise, making it clear to recruiters and employers why they should care within 10 seconds.

## Problem Statement

Current homepage is too generic:
- Doesn't lead with company building/transformation expertise
- Doesn't mention specific domain expertise (payments, fintech)
- Generic tagline doesn't differentiate or create interest
- No clear invitation to connect

## Design Decisions

### 1. Positioning Strategy

**Primary:** Company building and scaling
**Credibility anchor:** Deep fintech/payments expertise at Pleo

**Core thesis:** "I turn complexity into advantage"
**Scope of complexity:** Organizational structure, scaling teams, payments infrastructure, technical systems

### 2. Voice and Tone

**Style:** Builder identity - direct, confident, operator energy
**Opening:** Lead with what you do, not who you are
**Evidence:** Pleo as transformation story (100→850+ people, platform org, competitive moat)

### 3. Content Structure

**Opening paragraph:**
- Lead with builder identity and core thesis
- Enumerate types of complexity in natural order (people/org → tech/payments)
- Establish foundations/speed theme

**Proof paragraph:**
- Pleo experience framed as "platform organization" scaling
- Add "competitive moat" language to show transformation
- Keep timeframe (5 years) and scale (100→850+)

**Background paragraph:**
- Keep McKinsey + physicist arc
- Add "financial institutions" context to McKinsey
- Maintain personality ("atomic clocks")

**Navigation:**
- Keep existing About/Experience links

**Contact section:**
- Minimal and direct: "Let's connect: [LinkedIn] [Twitter]"
- Horizontal rule for separation
- Placeholder links for user to fill in

## Implementation

**File to edit:** `content/_index.md`

**Changes:**
1. Replace opening tagline with builder identity statement
2. Reframe Pleo paragraph to emphasize platform org + competitive advantage
3. Add financial institutions context to McKinsey line
4. Add contact section after navigation links

## Success Criteria

A recruiter or potential employer scanning the homepage for 10 seconds should understand:
- Stefan is a company builder/transformation leader (not just a fintech person)
- He has deep expertise in payments/fintech as proof
- He scales teams, organizations, and technical systems
- He's open to connecting
